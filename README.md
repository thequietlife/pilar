Why I started pilar

I wanted one spot to hang out with similar peeps - LGBTIQA+ peeps in cybersecurity.

Before setting up Pilar I had one channel in a slack that was very quiet, a few peeps I followed on twitter or looked at their websites. It felt scattered and I still found myself feeling isolated. Some communities are really big and too noisy.

I wanted a safe, supportive place for peeps to post selfies, chat about work stuff and share cool projects. The safe place to post selfies was a big motivator. I saw peeps posting selfies online and quite often there was little reaction. I wanted them to know that they looked amazing. I didnâ€™t want them to have to defend their choices but rather be acknowledged for the fabulous steps they were making and to know they looked beautiful and handsome. There can be a lot of hate towards peeps transitioning and I really wanted to provide a safe, supportive place for sharing that.
